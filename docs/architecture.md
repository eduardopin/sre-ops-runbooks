# Architecture and Component Model

## Scope

Sre Ops Runbooks focuses on reusable patterns rather than environment-specific deployments. Components are documented as replaceable building blocks with clear inputs, outputs and review checkpoints.

## Component Boundaries

- Interface: configuration, templates, policies or runbook inputs that callers control.
- Implementation: examples and scripts in this repository.
- Validation: local checks and GitHub Actions workflows that prevent obvious drift.
- Operations: ownership, escalation and maintenance notes in `docs/operating-model.md`.

## Design Principles

- Prefer explicit configuration over hidden defaults.
- Keep examples small enough to review.
- Separate policy decisions from execution mechanics.
- Document assumptions next to the implementation that depends on them.
